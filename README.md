**"Genomic Insights into the Prevalence and Genetic Diversity of *Salmonella* in Chicken Eggs in Saudi Arabia"**

Research background

Eggs are an important food source but can also serve as a vehicle for foodborne pathogens such as *Salmonella*. 

From **egg sampling** → **_Salmonella_ isolation** → **whole genome sequencing (WGS)** → **R-based analyses** → **figures**   

This project provides **genomic insights** into:  

- Prevalence of *Salmonella* serovars in chicken eggs  
- Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles and genetic determinants  
- The role of plasmids in spreading resistance genes  
- Virulence factors and their distribution across isolates  
- Pangenome structure and genetic diversity
