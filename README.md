## 🔬 Research background

Eggs are an important food source but also a potential vehicle for foodborne pathogens such as *Salmonella*. 

From 🥚 **egg sampling** → 🧫 **_Salmonella_ isolation** → 🧬 **whole genome sequencing (WGS)** → 📊 **R-based analyses** → 🖼️ **figures** → 🌍 **public health insights**  

This project provides **genomic insights** into:  

- 🧫 Prevalence of *Salmonella* serovars in chicken eggs  
- 💊 Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles and genetic determinants  
- 🔗 The role of plasmids in spreading resistance genes  
- 🧪 Virulence factors and their distribution across isolates  
- 🌀 Pangenome structure and genetic diversity
